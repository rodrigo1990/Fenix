    "Description": "How do we handle asynchronus postback in asp.net. When we do a postback on click of a button, editor looses typed in values and also toolbar becomes invisible and only plain textarea is visible.\n \nWhat I noticed is when we put the button inside updatepanel (ajax) editor looses the toolbar.\n \n \nAny suggestion to make this control supports partial postback?\n \nThanks,\nMani.",
