    "Description": "The updateTextArea() method was not firing in Firefox for a custom toolbar button I added. This turned out to be a problem with attaching the 'click' event to 'this.editor.body'. Changing it to $(this.editor).click() seems to work across IE and Firefox. Other browsers have not been tested. A pacth file is attached (the path also includes the update for this bug: http://jhtmlarea.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=8898).",
