    "Description": "Hey there. I have been looking for a good thml editor for my website. Well when I include jhtmlarea now, its like my page earms some extra-space on the side. Weirdly too, firebug displays me this line:\n<div class=\"ToolBar\" style=\"width: 1277px;\">\nThis width seems to cause the problems. But since the CSS is loaded before the html content, and the html content has priority with the style-attribute, i cant fix this width per css x.x\n \nIt would be good to add an option like:\n$('textarea').jhtmlarea({ width: \"90%\" });\n \nthe following links show my CSS used and also a copy of the html-page how it looks like in firebug.\nhttp://drachennetz.com/style/charabase.css <- CSS file\nhttp://pastebin.com/Pi1k5hLu <-- copy/paste from firebug output\n \n \ni hope you guys can help/fix this.\n \n \nEDIT: Uh, i fergot to mention, this only hapens on firefox.",
