    "Description": "I am using the BluePrint CSS framework and whenever I enabled jHtmlArea on a text area the border and background disappear.  You can see them for a split second before jHtmlArea is fully loaded.  You can still type in the box.  I have attached a screenshot of this problem on a very simple layout.",

      "Message": "Just following up to say this same problem exists when using the 960.gs CSS framework.  I believe the incompatibility stems from the use of reset stylesheets.   When I only include 960.css and omit the reset.css, the text areas show up properly.  Attempting to load jHtmlArea.css last and putting !important before each of it's css declaration endings does not get around the disappearing border/background.\r\n\r\nI think there is some element the jhtmlarea css file needs to define explicitly so it can function properly after a reset stylesheet is used.  The 960.gs demo uses this stylesheet if that helps http://960.gs/css/reset.css\r\n\r\n",
