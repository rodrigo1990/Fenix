    "Description": "Thanks for creating jhtmlarea. Works seamlessly and installs easily. However, one simple issue makes it unusable for me - the change event is no longer available, As a result, I cannot use jhtmlarea in an AJAX form. The change suggested here makes jhtmlarea incredibly slow, and I am not sure it works either:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237457/binding-onchange-event-to-jhtmlarea-textarea\n\nHopefully there can be a fix for this.\n\nThanks\nManish",
