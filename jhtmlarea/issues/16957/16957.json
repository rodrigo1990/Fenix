    "Description": "I was using jQuery-te as my WYSIWYG editor and tried jHtmlArea because the former removes end tags from the HTML markup that I enter.  It looks like jHtmlArea is doing the same thing.  I enter an <img src=\"xxx\" /> and it changes it to <img src=\"xxx\">.  I also tried inserting a </img> and it removed it when I switched from markup to WYSIWYG and back.  Anyway to change this behavior?  I need to save well-formed HTML.",
