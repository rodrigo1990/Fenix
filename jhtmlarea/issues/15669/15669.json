    "Description": "Using jHtmlArea 0.7.5 on a TextArea works like a charm i Chrome and FF on Win7 - but in IE9 on the same machine, all HTML characters are removed.\n\nI have a TextArea that receives the content from a jquery $.post callback, using Charles proxy I can see that the result is correctly formatted HTML (the same as in the other browsers) - but all formatting are stripped, all tags, everything - only plain text shown.\n\nThe editor is correctly displayed, buttons and all. Some things work, I can select text and then make it bold, but can't make a H1 - the first item in the text edited is btw a H1 ??",
