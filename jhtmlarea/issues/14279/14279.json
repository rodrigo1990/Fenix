    "Description": "When I have a html page that I am trying to edit that is long enough to generate a vertical scrollbar, if I try to select any of the text beyond the initial screen (by scrolling to the desired text), the text does not highlight and if I try to highlight text that crosses that boundry the text jumps to the end of the document.  Is there some setting that I need to modify to allow selecting of text beyond the first display area?   I have tried numerous html codes and it doesn't seem to be related to the content.\n \nAny ideas on how to solve this?\n \nNote I am using version 0.7.0.\n \nNote:  This problem seems to be an issue with only IE9,  Chome and IE8 work ok,  Hmmmm",
