    "Description": "jHtmlArea doesn't work well with IE and horizontal rules. It seems to write <hr id=\"ht\"> but I would rather see something like this: <hr/>\nI have used regexp to replace those /> endings.\nAnyway for some weird reason, it looks like when you use IE and save text containing hr-tag, reload text and save again, it generates extra <p>-tag which have no ending. Our system requires that all tags ends correctly.",
