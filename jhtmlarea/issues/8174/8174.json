    "Description": "Below is the description of what was done to get these methods to work, but it needs to be fixed at some point to \"properly\" support this functionality:\nÂ \nThe execCommand \"fontsize\" doesn't work in Safari, and it doesn't support \"increaseFontSize\" or \"decreaseFontSize\", so consiquentially the work around to get this working was to wrap the current selection in <span> tags with the css font-size set to \"smaller\" or \"larger\" appropriately. This isn't the ideal solution but it works.",
