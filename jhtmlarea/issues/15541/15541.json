    "Description": "Thanks for the great plugin. Looks and works great!\n \nI'm trying to use jHTMLArea to make a simple HTML email editor. To make this work it's necessary to have the HTML view display the <head> element. But when I paste a full HTML email template (including a <head> element) into the textarea, then click between the HTML and WYSIWYG view the doctype and some of the <head> tags are stripped out. Is there a way to get these to stay present?\n \nThanks",
