This file includes a somewhat generic color picker menu that can be used for any purpose, plus it includes the code to wire up and override the &#34;stock&#34; jHtmlColor.forecolor functionality and inject the new Color Picker Menu functionality in it&#39;s place when you click on the &#34;forecolor&#34; toolbar button.",

    "Description": "To keep the editor as light weight as possible, I don't want to create/add a Color Picker for use with the \"forecolor\" method. Instead the Color Picker will be created as an plugin/extension to the jHtmlArea object using it's nice extensibility model.",
