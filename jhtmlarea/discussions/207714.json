It doesn't show up visually, but when you view the source you can see it all and it all. I noticed this problem because I have set my max characters to 600, and when I cut and paste a couple of lines from word 2007 it ends up being around 24,000 characters. Whats going on? Anyone know how I can fix this? Thanks</p>",
