I figured since I was using jhtmlarea for free I should post it here. I don't claim to know what I am doing, just a hack.</p>\r\n<p>When i used the patch the and clicked on font family button it worked but the font names went to the right and out of the drop down. Guessing that my own css was interfering with the patch's I opened jHtmlArea.FontPickerMenu.css and found this line</p>\r\n<p>div.jHtmlAreaFontPickerMenu div {float: left; margin: 2px; width: 112px; height: 14px;}</p>\r\n<p>Changed it to this</p>\r\n<p>div.jHtmlAreaFontPickerMenu div {float: left; margin: 2px; width: 112px; height: 14px; text-align: left;}</p>\r\n<p>iow, added text-align: left;</p>\r\n<p>No biggie but figured someone who knows even less than me might try the patch and get a headache trying to change it.</p>\r\n<p>thanks again!</p>\r\n",
