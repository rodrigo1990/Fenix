You would have to write a jHtmlArea specific one yourself i guess.</p>\r\n<p>The only possible approach i could think of is using the hidden texatea element where jHtmlArea stores the Content, give that the expandable option and than build a listener that copys it's height/width attributes to the iFrame box of jHtmlArea.</p>\r\n<p>Good luck and pleaee post any results you have.</p>",
