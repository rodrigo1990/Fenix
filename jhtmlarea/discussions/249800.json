Also i need the option to include &quot;captions&quot; and &quot;alt&quot; tags.</p>\r\n<p>So i want to change the behaviour of editing images in jHtmlArea. I would like to take away the Event Listener on the img tags and add my own so hovering the images will show buttons that i wil lattatch to functions/dialog boxes.</p>\r\n<p>How can i access those event listeners and the behaviour?</p>\r\n",
