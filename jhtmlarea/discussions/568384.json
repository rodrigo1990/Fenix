    "Html": "I have jHtmlArea successfully installed. The edit function works fine. I have customized the selection of buttons in the toolbar and that works fine. I've also added one custom button, and it executes its function correctly, but I can't for the life of me get the little image to display in the button itself, the button is blank. I have added the image to jHtmlArea.png, the code that defines the button has a unique css value, and that style is defined in jHtmlArea.css. I have even tried using the exact same css as another button just to see if I can get any image to display in the button, but so far no luck. Does anyone have any ideas on this?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nstevex64<br />\n",
