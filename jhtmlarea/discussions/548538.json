Now, my requirement is that I want its height to be resizable by using a mouse as per requirement after the control is loaded on the page. In case the text is more and the user wants to view it all at once, he/she should be able to simply drag the textbox corner(s) to get the desired height? Please let me know how this would be possible. <br />\n",
